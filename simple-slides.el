;;; Commentary:
;;
;; show page-break (^L) separated files as slides.
;;
;; call M-x slide-init to start with the current buffer
;;
;; use s-] and s-[ to navigate (note: that's the Super, or Windows,
;; or Cmd key, depending on your OS and its configuration).
;;
;; use M-x slide-quit to stop
;;
;; currently messes with the global font settings. sorry about that.
